### Repository Structure

The code is organized by chapter, with each folder containing:

- Complete implementations of all code listings referenced in the book
- Additional helper functions and utilities
- Sample data files where applicable
- Chapter-specific README files mapping code to book sections
- Chapter-specific dependency management with `pyproject.toml` and lock files

### How to Use This Repository

1. **Find the code you need**: Each chapter in the book references code examples as "Listing A.X". Navigate to the corresponding chapter folder and find the same listing number.

2. **Install dependencies**: Each chapter has its own dependency management. Navigate to the chapter directory and run `uv sync`.

3. **Run the examples**: Each Python file is self-contained and can be executed with `uv run`.

4. **Experiment and extend**: The code is designed to be modified and expanded upon. Use it as a starting point for your own projects.

### Dependencies

Most examples require Python 3.9+ and common data science libraries. We use `uv` for dependency management.

#### Installing `uv`

**macOS/Linux:**
```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

**Windows:**
```bash
powershell -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
```

For more installation options, visit: https://github.com/astral-sh/uv

#### Installing Dependencies

To install dependencies for a specific chapter:

```bash
cd chapter01
uv sync
```

This will automatically set up a virtual environment and install all required dependencies defined in the chapter's `pyproject.toml` file.

#### Running Examples

To run any Python file using `uv`:

```bash
cd chapter01
uv run python listing_a1.py
```
